	\subsubsection{Proposed Operational Concept}
		The application will allow metro riders to use their mobile devices to purchase tickets and board trains eliminating the need for physical TAP cards. The new system will act as a complement to the TAP card system; allowing riders to use existing metro facilities if they wish.
		
		For those smartphones enabled with NFC, the rider will be able to “tap” their phones instead of their tap cards. For those smartphones not enable with NFC, QR readers will be installed at stations that have turnstiles. For stations that do not have turnstiles, Metro agents will be given a QR reader to verify tickets on the train.
